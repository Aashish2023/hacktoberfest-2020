    <p>The song is most recognizable from the Apple commercial in late October 2018 for the MacBook Air.<br>


In an interview with Pop Dust on July 23rd, 2018, Chelsea Lee answered two questions about to “Trampoline.” She said that the band was simply trying to write a great song, and “Trampoline” was a build-up from working in a studio every day.<br>

The idea behind the song was inspired by watching a home video of Max and Spencer Ernst (both are band members) jumping on a trampoline. They wanted to tell a story that played along with their surrounding environment outside of their home. This story was focused around the idea of the “Upside Down” (a Stranger Things reference), and they wanted the plot to be similar to Alice In Wonderland.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>What have the artists said about the song?</strong><br><br>
      One of our favorites from our EP :)</p>
        <p><strong>Has the song received any accolades?</strong> <br><br>
“Trampoline” has reportedly <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/MediaCharts/status/1185621459932024832">“broken the record for most Spotify pre-saves in 24 hours.”</a></p>

<p><strong>What was the process of making the song like?</strong> <br><br>
We wrote all the melodies by passing around the microphone, and taking turns coming up with ideas. Chelsea recorded most of the vocals in her little office where she sets up her microphone, while the boys produced out the track in the studio. We also collaborated with the super talented Alex Mendoza, who co-produced the song.</p>

  <p><strong>How did this song perform on the Billboard charts?</strong> <br><br>
  During the week ending September 14, 2019, “Trampoline” peaked at #37 on the Hot 100</p>

  <p><strong>What inspired this song?</strong> <br><br>
    Max and Spencer were visiting their parents and watching old home videos. There’s a video where the twins are jumping up and down on a trampoline, and the film had this dreamlike, distorted quality to it. The first line of the song is a direct reference to that, but the rest of the lyrics evolved into a story about embracing and falling in love with our biggest fears.</p>
