    <p>Originally an instrumental from August 2014 titled “Fade,” Alan released this updated version with vocals in December 2015 under the slightly-altered name “Faded.”</p>

<p>“I’m still just an eighteen year old from Bergen in Norway,” Walker told Genius. Until “Faded” blew up, he was “more concerned about [his] homework and lack of focus in studies than on having a song that was topping the charts in many territories.”</p>
<p>I’m just really humble and grateful for the response and feedback this track has gotten. Unimaginable, if that’s possible to say. Just unreal!</p>
